In order to replicate and execute our code, the following steps must be completed in the given order:

Step 1: Run 'main.py' script from image processing folder, using a configuration containing openCV and Numpy. 
Step 2: As default the program will process the attached image "cam_live.jpg". If a webcam is to be used, change the "webcam_enable" option from False to True
	When the setup is in focus, hit the 'q'-button on your keyboard to take a picture for image processing.
Step 3: Run 'RDK_program' to import the CSV-file from the previous script and activate the UR5
Step 4: Watch the UR5 grab and stack the Simpsons family in LEGO Duplo bricks.

Thank you.

Kind regards
